        <p>Our Quality</p>
        <div class="noidung1">
            <p>Open Country Dairy puts quality and accountability at the core of all activities. All Open Country Dairy sites comply with the highest food safety accreditation in New Zealand and have gained the globally recognised FSSC 22000 accreditation. Our plants operate using the latest technically engineered systems to ensure all product categories meet our standards in uniformity and consistency, from site delivery through processing to packaging.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="noidung1">
            <p>Final products are tested by an ISO 17025 laboratory, and we are accountable to the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) through our Risk Management Programme and Plan, plus our HACCP plan. Attention to service and quality defines our food safety standards allowing us to manufacture for Halal and Kosher certification. Our Quality – The Best In Dairy.</p>

        <p>Our Environment</p>
        <div class="noidung1">
            <p>Open Country Dairy understands the reliance our business, our farmers, our products and our customers have on the exquisite environment of New Zealand. Our commitment lies not only with New Zealand, but encompasses an environmentally sustainable, ethically sound and socially responsible Earth for us all. Our understanding is translated into action by partnering with thinkstep, a leader in sustainability performance management, as we aim to preserve the natural resource from which we draw.</p>

        <p>Going Organic</p>
        <div class="noidung1">
            <p>Our world and our awareness of its future are changing. Our awareness too of the way we live, what we eat and how we care for our planet is changing. A few years ago Open Country Dairy had the opportunity to move into organics when the world market started to recognise the high quality of milk sourced from organically farmed, grass-fed animals and the very tough codes of food safety compliance it required. We will be one of the largest organic processors in New Zealand and we’re very proud of our organic milk and our Awarua facility in the southern-most region, not only in New Zealand but in the world.</p>
